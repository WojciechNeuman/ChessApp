# ChessApp

### In this repository I plan to create a ChessApp called ***Chess Universe***. 

My current goal is to create a basic application, that gives user a possibility to play versus chess engine of at least 1000 ELO strength or other opponent. 

Possible future goals:
- improving a chess engine, so that it would beat me in a game (I'm +2000 ELO on online platforms),
- adding other chess engines for other chess modes,
- adding registration possibility (including user games history),
- inviting my colleagues to collaboration :)
