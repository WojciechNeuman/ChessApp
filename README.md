# Chess Universe
Welcome to Chess Universe, a repository for a ChessApp that allows you to play against a chess engine or other opponents.

## Project Goal

The current goal of this Project is to create a basic application, that gives user a possibility to play versus chess engine of at least 1000 ELO strength or other opponent. 

### Possible future goals include:

- Improving the chess engine so that it can beat me in a game (I'm +2000 ELO on online platforms).
- Adding other chess engines for different chess modes.
- Adding registration options (including user games history).
-  Inviting my colleagues to collaborate :)

## Current Status

Here is a screenshot of the current state of the application as of 10.04.2023:
